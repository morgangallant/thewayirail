This is our submission for the McHacks RailVision Challenge 2022.

Our near-optimal solution is located in 4.51.csv (meaning on average, the passengers waited for 4.51 minutes).

We wrote a web server which allows anyone to upload an arrivals document (e.g. passengers.csv) and get results, in addition to an animation showing how the trains move over time. This is deployed at https://rail.morgangallant.com. To use, please upload the passengers.csv file included in this repo.
